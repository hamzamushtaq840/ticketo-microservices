    kubectl get pods 

  #To check if clusterIP services were created as well from yaml as service provide network between pods
  also we need a name and post from here to send internal requests
    kubectl get services  

  #After any changes in source code you need to build docker and push after that restart all deployments so they make pod from latest images
  kubectl rollout restart deployment

  #For nginx so it routes request to clusterIP of desired service
  kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/controller-v1.10.1/deploy/static/provider/cloud/deploy.yaml
